<h1>Discord DeltaMusic 🤖 <h1> 

A music bot for discord made entirely in JavaScript.
  
  ### Project still in progress, but currently focusing entirely on music. ⚠️
  
  To run your bot perfectly follow the steps below ⬇️
  
  + 1º - Have downloaded and installed Node JS (to make the code easier to see, I recommend VS Studio Code).
  + 2º - Download and extract the file in some folder.
  + 3º - Open the folder inside Visual Studio Code.
  + 4º - Open the terminal and type **npm i** to download all the dependencies needed to run the bot.
  + 5º - Then open index.js and on the last line in **client.login('')** type your APP token inside the quotes.
  + 6º - Then open the **config** folder and open the **config.json** and **settings.json** files and edit the **prefix** thus putting your desired prefix.
  + 7º - If you want to test the bot before hosting on a host, just run **node .** inside the terminal.
